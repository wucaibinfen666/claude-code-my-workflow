[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/See-CHANGELOG-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)
[![Contributing](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

> **Actively maintained.** A summary of how I use Claude Code for academic work — slides, papers, data analysis, and more — packaged so you can fork it for your own research. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes.

**Live site:** [psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/)

A ready-to-fork foundation for AI-assisted academic work. You describe what you want — lecture slides, a research paper, a data analysis, a replication package — and Claude plans the approach, runs specialized agents, fixes issues, verifies quality, and presents results. Like a contractor who handles the entire job. Extracted from a production PhD course and extended by a growing [community](#community--extensions).

---

## Quick Start (5–10 minutes, plus ~30 min for first-time installs)

> **Before you start:** Claude Code + git are the minimum. To run the included `HelloWorld` demos end-to-end you also need XeLaTeX (Beamer sample) and Quarto (Quarto sample). R and the GitHub CLI are recommended. Python 3 is used by a few internal scripts (`check-palette-sync.py`, `check-tikz-prevention.py`) and is pre-installed on macOS/Linux. Full list in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below. Fastest path: clone first, then run `./scripts/validate-setup.sh` — it reports exactly what's missing with install links.
>
> **Only need Python/R/markdown?** You don't need XeLaTeX or Quarto. The agents, rules, skills, and orchestration patterns work for any text/code artifact. Skip the `HelloWorld` demos and head straight to `/data-analysis`, `/review-paper`, `/lit-review`, or `/review-r`.
>
> **Session 2 onwards:** [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md) (committed) collects generic `[LEARN]` entries that help all forkers; `.claude/state/personal-memory.md` (gitignored) is for machine-specific notes. See [`.claude/rules/meta-governance.md`](.claude/rules/meta-governance.md) for the distinction.

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub (click "Fork" on the repo page), then:
git clone https://github.com/wucaibinfen666/claude-code-my-workflow.git my-project
cd my-project
./scripts/validate-setup.sh        # reports missing tools with install links
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Start Claude Code and Paste This Prompt

```bash
claude
```

**Using VS Code?** Open the Claude Code panel instead. Everything works the same — see the [full guide](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-setup) for details.

> **Avoid prompt fatigue.** Out of the box, Claude Code asks permission for every tool invocation. After the first few approvals, toggle **Auto-accept edits** mode (a keybinding; see the [permission modes section](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#settings---permissions-and-hooks) of the guide) or run `claude --permission-mode acceptEdits`. For fully-autonomous runs on a trusted repo, **Bypass** mode skips prompts entirely. The template's `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves ~100 common Bash and Edit/Write patterns, so even at default permissions most work is unattended.

Then paste the [starter prompt](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-first-session) from the guide, filling in your project details:

> I am starting to work on **[PROJECT NAME]** in this repo. **[Describe your project in 2–3 sentences.]** I've set up the Claude Code academic workflow... Please read the configuration files and adapt them for my project. Enter plan mode and start.

The [full guide](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-first-session) has the complete starter prompt with all the details.

**What this does:** Claude reads all the configuration files, fills in your project name, institution, and preferences, then enters contractor mode — planning, implementing, and (within the skill you invoke) running the review + verify loop. You approve the plan, invoke a skill, and the skill handles the rest within its scope.

> **Heavily adapting CLAUDE.md for a non-academic project?** Anthropic's built-in `/init` command will re-derive a `CLAUDE.md` from your codebase as a starting point. The pre-shipped CLAUDE.md in this template already covers the academic setup — you only need `/init` if your fork diverges substantially (e.g., a Python/ML project that doesn't use LaTeX or Quarto).

### 3. Verify Your Setup

Before building real lectures, confirm your environment works:

```bash
./scripts/validate-setup.sh        # Checks XeLaTeX, Quarto, Python, git, etc.
```

Then inside Claude:

```text
/compile-latex HelloWorld          # Compiles Slides/HelloWorld.tex to PDF
/deploy HelloWorld                 # Renders Quarto/HelloWorld.qmd to HTML
```

If both succeed, delete `Slides/HelloWorld.tex` and `Quarto/HelloWorld.qmd` and start on your real work.

---

## How It Works

### Contractor Mode

You describe a task. For complex or ambiguous requests, Claude first creates a requirements specification with MUST/SHOULD/MAY priorities and clarity status (CLEAR/ASSUMED/BLOCKED). You approve the spec, then Claude plans the approach and invokes the right skill (e.g. `/create-lecture`, `/qa-quarto`, `/review-paper --adversarial`). That skill implements the orchestrator pattern internally — implement, verify, review, fix, re-verify, score — and returns a summary when the work meets quality standards. Say "just do it" and it auto-commits when the score clears 80.

### Specialized Agents

Instead of one general-purpose reviewer, 14 focused agents each check one dimension. A representative sample:

- **proofreader** — grammar/typos
- **slide-auditor** — visual layout
- **pedagogy-reviewer** — teaching quality
- **r-reviewer** — R code quality
- **domain-reviewer** — field-specific correctness, slides (template — customize for your field)
- **domain-referee** / **methods-referee** / **editor** — manuscript peer-review pipeline (`/review-paper --peer`)

Each is better at its narrow task than a generalist would be. The `/slide-excellence` skill runs the slide-review agents in parallel; `/review-paper --peer` runs the paper-review pipeline. The same pattern extends to any academic artifact — manuscripts, data pipelines, proposals.

### Adversarial QA

Two agents work in opposition: the **critic** reads both Beamer and Quarto and produces harsh findings. The **fixer** implements exactly what the critic found. They loop until the critic says "APPROVED" (or 5 rounds max). This catches errors that single-pass review misses.

### Quality Review

Every artifact gets a score (0–100). Scores below threshold halt the workflow and surface the findings — the user decides whether to fix or explicitly override:

- **80** — commit threshold
- **90** — PR threshold
- **95** — excellence (aspirational)

> **Framing honesty:** Thresholds are advisory at the harness level — the `/commit` skill runs quality checks and halts on failure, but there is no pre-commit git hook that blocks a direct `git commit`. If you bypass the skill, you bypass the review. For hard enforcement, configure a git pre-commit hook.

### Context Survival

Plans, specifications, and session logs survive auto-compression and session boundaries. The PreCompact hook saves a context snapshot before Claude's auto-compression triggers, ensuring critical decisions are never lost. MEMORY.md accumulates learning across sessions, so patterns discovered in one session inform future work.

For *forced* compression (long pipelines, mid-plan handoffs), `/compress-session` (v1.9.0) distils the conversation into a structured note — decisions, next actions, and **discarded-as-noise** — instead of letting auto-compaction truncate. `/promote-memory` (v1.9.0) periodically harvests generic learnings from gitignored personal-memory.md to committed MEMORY.md via a five-critic council.

### Verification Discipline (v1.7.0+)

Multiple complementary verification layers run before submission:

- **`/verify-claims`** (v1.7.0) — Chain-of-Verification with a forked verifier that cannot self-confirm because it has never seen the draft. v1.9.0 adds HIGH/MED/LOW-WARN severity tiers; HIGH-WARN (fabricated citation, numerical contradiction) gate-refuses `/commit`.
- **`/audit-reproducibility`** (v1.7.0; Stata coverage v1.9.0) — every numeric claim in the manuscript is cross-checked against the script output that produced it. v1.9.0 adds `passport.yaml` — a per-paper YAML state file with PASS/FAIL/STALE/UNVERIFIED status per claim.
- **`/humanize`** (v1.9.0) — detect AI-voice tells (boilerplate transitions, hedging stacking, sycophancy) before submission. Read-only by design; auto-rewriting degrades quality.
- **`/review-paper --variance N`** (v1.9.0) — runs N referees with sampled dispositions and reports a **decision distribution**, not a point estimate. Motivated by AgentReview (ACL 2024) finding 37% of decisions vary purely from disposition sampling.

### 2026 Features

The guide covers Claude Code's latest capabilities:

- **Model lineup** (v1.9.0) — Opus 4.7 as Max/Team Premium default (GA 2026-04-16); Sonnet 4.6 workhorse (1M context); Haiku 4.5 fast tier. Sonnet 4 + original Opus 4 retire 2026-06-15.
- **Effort levels** — `/effort` command for cost vs. thoroughness tradeoffs (`low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` (v1.9.0 — recommended for Opus 4.7 coding) / `max`)
- **`/goal <verifiable condition>`** (v1.9.0; Anthropic May 2026) — keep working across turns until a fast model confirms the condition holds. Pairs with `/commit` quality gates for verified-end-state runs.
- **`claude agents` dashboard** (v1.9.0; Anthropic May 2026) — single screen for parallel review work (`/review-paper --peer`, `/slide-excellence`).
- **Cost-Conscious Composition** (v1.9.0) — prompt-cache TTL change (60min → 5min), 70/20/10 model routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), `/cost` + `/usage` monitoring, Agent SDK credit-pool split (2026-06-15).
- **Skill frontmatter** — `effort`, `context: fork`, `agent`, `hooks`, `disable-model-invocation` (v1.8.0+), and dynamic content (`$ARGUMENTS`, `!command` syntax)
- **Permission modes** — Normal, Auto-accept, Plan, Auto (Mar 2026; flag-free for Max+Opus 4.7 as of Apr 2026), Bypass
- **Hook handler types** — command, prompt, and HTTP handlers with 20+ hook events; hooks see `effort.level` and `$CLAUDE_EFFORT` (Apr 2026 Week 19)
- **Advanced agent configuration** — model, maxTurns, isolation, tool restrictions; `model-routing.md` rule codifies per-agent tier (v1.9.0)
- **Worktree base ref** (v1.9.0; Anthropic Apr 2026) — `worktree.baseRef` setting controls `fresh` (default; remote default-branch) vs `head` (local HEAD) for new worktrees
- **Built-in skills** — `/fewer-permission-prompts`, `/team-onboarding`, `/autofix-pr`, `/powerup`, Ultraplan, `/loop` (self-pacing)
- **Plugins** — `/discover-plugins` for third-party extensions

### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

Rules use path-scoped loading: **always-on** rules load every session (~100 lines total); **path-scoped** rules load only when Claude works on matching files. Claude follows ~150 instructions reliably, so less is more.

**Always-on** (no `paths:` frontmatter — load every session):

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required For | Install |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) | Everything | [claude.ai/install](https://claude.ai/install) |
| git | Clone + version control | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| Python 3 (3.9+) | Internal checkers (palette sync, TikZ prevention) | Preinstalled on macOS/Linux; [python.org](https://www.python.org/) for Windows |
| XeLaTeX | LaTeX compilation (Beamer `HelloWorld`, real lectures) | [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) |
| [Quarto](https://quarto.org) | Web slides (Quarto `HelloWorld`, real lectures) | [quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) |
| R | Figures and analysis (`/data-analysis`, `scripts/R/` template) | [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) |
| pdf2svg | TikZ → SVG for Quarto (`/extract-tikz`) | `brew install pdf2svg` (macOS), `apt install pdf2svg` (Debian) |
| [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) | PR / issue workflow | `brew install gh` (macOS), `apt install gh` (Debian) |

**Minimum to fork this template:** Claude Code + git + Python 3 (Python is already installed on macOS/Linux).

**Minimum to run the included HelloWorld demos end-to-end:** add XeLaTeX (for `/compile-latex HelloWorld`) and Quarto (for `/deploy HelloWorld`).

**Your real lectures may need more** — R for `scripts/R/` analyses, pdf2svg if you use TikZ extraction, gh CLI if you use the PR-based commit workflow. `./scripts/validate-setup.sh` reports which of these are installed and what each unlocks.

## Adapting for Your Field

1. **Fill in the knowledge base** (`.claude/rules/knowledge-base-template.md`) with your notation, applications, and design principles
2. **Customize the domain reviewer** (`.claude/agents/domain-reviewer.md`) with review lenses specific to your field
3. **Update the color palette** — this is a **two-surface contract**: change the HEX values at the top of **both** [`Preambles/header.tex`](Preambles/header.tex) (Beamer/TikZ) **and** [`Quarto/theme-template.scss`](Quarto/theme-template.scss) (Quarto slides) so they agree. Then run `./scripts/check-palette-sync.sh` to verify. Forgetting one surface silently produces mismatched Beamer vs. Quarto renderings. See [`Preambles/README.md`](Preambles/README.md) for the full contract and the TikZ style library.
4. **Add field-specific R pitfalls** to `.claude/rules/r-code-conventions.md`
5. **Fill in the lecture mapping** in `.claude/rules/beamer-quarto-sync.md`
6. **Customize the workflow quick reference** (`.claude/WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md`) with your non-negotiables and preferences
7. **Set up the exploration folder** (`explorations/`) for experimental work

## Origin

This infrastructure was extracted from **Econ 730: Causal Panel Data** at Emory University, developed by Pedro Sant'Anna using Claude Code over 6+ sessions. The course produced 6 complete PhD lecture decks with 800+ slides, interactive Quarto versions with plotly charts, and full R replication packages — all managed through this multi-agent workflow. The patterns are domain-agnostic: the same agents, rules, and orchestrator work for any academic project.

---

## Community & Extensions

As of March 2026, **15+ research groups** across economics, energy, political science, and engineering have forked and adapted this workflow. The infrastructure (orchestrator, hooks, quality gates) transfers without modification.
